Alea iacta is means "The die is cast"
It is a variation of a latin phrase,iacta alea est [ˈjakta ˈaːlɛ.a ˈɛs̺t], attributed by Suetonius to Julius Caesar on 10 January 49 BC
It was as he led his army acr0ss the Rubicon river in Northern Italy
He then entered Italy at the head of his army in defiance of the Senate
He started his lon civil war agains Pompey and the Obtimates
The phrase is used to indicate that an event has passed a point of no return
It is now most commonly cited with the word order changed ("Alea iacta est") rather than in the original phrasing
The same event inspired another idiom with the same meaning, "crossing the Rubicon"
